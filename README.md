# Online Fitness and Nutrition Platform - Backend

This repository contains the backend component of the Online Fitness and Nutrition Platform, built with Python and the Flask web framework.

## Overview

The backend provides APIs and services for managing user profiles, tracking fitness activities and nutrition intake, generating personalized workout and meal plans, and more. It integrates with third-party APIs for fitness tracking and nutrition data.

## Architecture

The backend follows a modular and scalable architecture, organized into the following main components:

- **APIs**: Defines the API endpoints for user profiles, fitness tracking, and nutrition tracking.
- **Models**: Defines the database models for storing user profiles, fitness data, and nutrition data.
- **Services**: Contains the business logic and services for fitness tracking, nutrition tracking, plan generation, and other core functionalities.
- **Extensions**: Initializes and configures third-party extensions (e.g., database, API clients, caching).
- **Utils**: Contains utility functions used across the application.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (version 3.9 or later)
- **Flask** (web framework)
- **PostgreSQL** (database)
- **SQLAlchemy** (ORM)
- **Alembic** (database migrations)
- **Gunicorn** (WSGI HTTP server)
- **Docker** (containerization)
- **Kubernetes** (container orchestration)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements/base.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
   - Update the database connection details in the `app/config.py` file.
   - Run the database migrations:
     ```
     flask db upgrade
     ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

### Docker Setup

Alternatively, you can run the backend using Docker:
